location,description
"40.861341, -8.117199",also called the magical village it is an old abandoned village. From little churches inside of boulders to hundreds of animals coexisting this place has hundreds of little lakes and pools. Truly magical hikes.
"40.228996, -7.822571",nested on the side of a moutain one of the most stricking features is the blue color around windows and doors. For many decades the complete isolation led the village to only have one type of paint available. The contrast of the color with the schist makes this a very special place with very unique drinks and food. The hikes around this area are breath taking.

"41.754986, -8.861674","little albergue that often hosts pilgrims for the camino de santiago has an incredible view to the ocean, one of the chillest horse that thinks he is a dog I've met."
"41.701657, -8.835060",there is no way I can describe the view you get from this place. You have to go there. Also it looks like a little portuguese taj mahal
,if you make your way to this dataset message me I will give you the directions to this place. It is a very small restaurant that if you are able to book at a specific time you get to have a front row seat to an incredible sunset while you have grilled fish fresh out of the boat. Surrounding this restaurant there are dozens of art pieces carved with seashells evocative of portuguese history and the fights with the adamastor

,"this one hurts to share. This place is very easy to miss, just 2 little doors, inside only 12 people are seated at a time, exquisit bottles of wine cover the walls up to the ceiling. The food is something is something that needs to be felt and not described. you see it be cooked and it is always paired with some sort of magical twin wine. favorite restaurant in the country."
